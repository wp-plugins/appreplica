Appreplica lets you add content from 3rd party websites such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr, iTunes, Flickr, etc. to your WordPress websites.

== Description ==

Add full featured third party content from your favorite sites to your WordPress powered websites with one plugin. For example, our YouTube App embeds your entire YouTube channel, almost as though viewers were looking at your channel on YouTube itself. We currently have free apps for YouTube, Vimeo, iTunes, Spotify, Deezer, SoundCloud, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest, 500px, Flickr, and SmugMug. A paid subscription on Appreplica also adds additional apps for Photos, Videos and Music galleries.

With a fully cloud based service and a lightweight WordPress plugin, adding these apps to your WordPress will not slow down your WordPress websites as all the content is rendered in the cloud and remotely displayed in your WordPress pages.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get started? =

First sign up for a free account on [Appreplica.com](http://www.appreplica.com). It will take just a few minutes to configure the apps on Appreplica. 

= What makes Appreplica different than other plugins? =

Appreplica is different than almost all other WordPress plugins in that it's a cloud based solution. This means rather than the complex code running on your own server where it can slow down your own server or possibly cause conflict with other plugins and themes, it instead runs on Appreplica's distributed cloud based servers and the content is remotely displayed in your website using a combination of AJAX and iFrames.

It's very similar for example to an embedded YouTube video. YouTube's servers handle the complex tasks of rendering the video, paying for the bandwidth, etc. and your browser simply displays the video with virtually no impact on your own server's performance.
       
= Will it work with all themes? =

Our plugin should work with virtually all WordPress themes. Our plugin is very "lightweight" and should not conflict with any other plugins or impact the performance of your overall website. With one plugin, you can add one or all of our apps. There is no need to install a separate plugin for each app, our unique plugin handles all the apps with just one plugin.

= Is this service really free? =

Absolutely! We offer a 100% free basic plan without all the limitations imposed by the many other providers.

= How often is the content updated? =

All apps are updated in realtime. You never have to manually sync or do anything special for your latest social media postings and updates to be reflected in your pages. Just add content to your social media sites and magically see the changes reflected on your pages.
 
= Are there limits on visitors, bandwidth, etc.? =

Nope! We offer truly unlimited usage! Whether you get one visitor or millions of visitors, our service will display your content from our worldwide network of servers powered by Amazon Web Services with virtually no performance impact on your own hosting service.

= How do you make money? =

Some of our users upgrade to take advantage of the more advanced customization options and that's plenty for us to support and maintain this service.

= Why aren't there free versions of your Photo and Videos apps? =

These two apps are very special in that they provide a powerful photo and video gallery content management system with unlimited storage and bandwidth powered by Amazon's worldwide CloudFront content delivery network. Since the storage and bandwidth costs are quite costly, these two apps are limited to subscribing members only.

= How can I get support? =

This service is so easy to use that we're confident 99% of you won't need any extra help, but feel free to email us at support@appreplica.com if you have any questions about this service. Free unlimited support is available to all our valued users.
